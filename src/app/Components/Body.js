				Clover Story is a non-linear platform action game, set in two fantastic worlds
				(Physical and spiritual), full of magical beings and evil creatures.
				The magical world of Faboles is the victim of an evil entity: Arcane. With a fairly high centering capacity, it has taken over many villages and towns. It is the cause of the extinction of many races, in addition to countless stolen spirits that make it one of the most powerful beings on earth.
				Our hero Kenn, coming from perhaps the most important race in history, will take his focus to a level that no being has been able to reach, called the State of Clover. Kenn is certain that he came into the world to something important and will not die without reaching his destination. With the help of the fairy Pibo, he will put an end to evil.
